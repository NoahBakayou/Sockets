## Features

- Establish a socket connection between a client and a server.
- Send and receive messages between client and server.
- Calculate the sum of numbers received from the client.
- Support for both TCP and UDP protocols.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NoahBakayou/Sockets.git
```
2. Navigate to the src directory:
```shell
cd Sockets/src
```
3. You can explore the provided Java scripts to understand how socket communication works.

## Usage
- This project contains several Java classes in the src directory that demonstrate different aspects of socket programming. Here are a few common scenarios:

- TCP Server and Client: Check out SocketServer and SocketClient for an example of setting up a TCP server and client.

- UDP Server and Client: Look at SocketServer and SocketClient for an example of setting up a UDP server and client.

- Custom Communication: Modify these scripts or create your own based on your networking requirements.

- Remember to customize and extend these examples to meet your project's needs.
